# Getting Started
Using a git-based terminal such as gitbash, first navigate to the directoy where you'd like to clone the repository

For Windows
``
$ cd C:/Users/user/my_project
``
For Linux
```
$ cd /home/user/my_project
```
 Once you have changed to the directory where you wish to clone the repositry you then use 
 
 ```
 $ git clone https://github.com/Emerixean/Online-Banking-System---P1.git
 ```
 
 Once that is done you should have the majority of the project.
 
 Next you must use PostgreSQL 10 and a RDBMS application such as DBeaver to set up a local database installation.
 
 Next locate the file included with the repository labeled "RDBMSscript.txt"
 Running the script in the text file with a RDBMS will create the necessary database tables for the project. Then you must add an employee:
 
 ```
 insert into employee_table values(1,'William','Fargo','WellsFargo','NYNY1852');
 ```
 
 This creates an employee with username WellsFargo and password NYNY1852.
 Now the final step is to set up system enviroment variables for your database credentials.
 
 For Windows:
  Use the search function on the taskbar to find "Edit the system environment variables"
  Click the button near the bottom that says "Environment Variables"
  For the system variables section click "New.."
  Name the variable TRAINING_DB_USERNAME and set its value equal to your database username
    For the system variables section click "New.."
  Name the variable TRAINING_DB_PASSWORD and set its value equal to your database password
  
  For Unix systems you will need to find proper online guides to create the same system variables.
  
  ## Usage
  Once you have your system ready, you can compile and run the program with your IDE or compiler of choice.
  
  Once you have the program running open a web browser of your choice and connect to the local host:
http://localhost:8080/welcome-menu.html

You are now free to navigate the website, create customers, apply for accounts, etc.
